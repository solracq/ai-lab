# AI Lab (Python)

This repository contains applied AI projects implemented in Python, focused on exploring how AI techniques can enhance test automation, diagnostics, and engineering workflows.

The projects in this repository emphasize practical experimentation rather than production-ready solutions, with a focus on solving real automation and quality engineering problems.

## Projects

- **Automation Test Prioritizer**  
  Experiments with AI-driven approaches to prioritize automated tests based on risk, impact, or historical execution data to optimize regression cycles.

- **Self-Healing API Tests**  
  Explores techniques for detecting and adapting to API changes automatically, reducing test brittleness and maintenance effort in CI/CD pipelines.

- **AI Agent Search**  
  Investigates the use of AI agents to perform search and decision-making tasks, with potential applications in automation support and problem-solving workflows.

This repository serves as a personal engineering lab to evaluate how AI can be applied pragmatically to improve automation reliability, efficiency, and developer productivity.
